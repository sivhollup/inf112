# Mandatory Exercise 2: RoboRally

This semester's programming project is to create a digital version of RoboRally. In RoboRally, a series of flags are placed on the game board, and then it is the players' task to navigate the board to get to all the flags as quickly as possible. The navigation itself is done by adding the program cards each player receives in the desired sequence, "compiling" the sequence and letting the robots round the instruction set.

The rule book can be found [here](https://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/roborally.pdf).

The game must be written in Java, with the game engine [LibGdx] (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). For testing, JUnit should be used.

You are free to choose between Maven and the gradle build systems. A skeleton project with libgdx, JUnit and Maven will be provided, which can be used. This is completely voluntary, and you can also set up the project yourselves.

## Part 1: Organize the team

The group needs:

* A name for the group.
* A team lead, who follows up on tasks and the project board.
* A customer contact, who becomes the group's main expertise on the domain.

Map out the competence of the various members of the group and write a short summary, as well as delegating roles.

You need to find out which technical tools you want to use. One possibility is to use a github project board or trello. This must be set up, and it is important that everyone in the group knows how to use the tools you decide on.

## Part 2 - Get an overview of the expected product

This semester's programming project is to create a digital version of RoboRally. This version should include most of RoboRally's features such as process cards, game board mechanisms, and multiple gameplay capabilities.

You must create a specification to include:

* A brief description of the overall goal of the application.
* A list of requirements for the system based on the high level requirements reviewed in lecture.
* A priority list of which requirements you want to include in the first iteration (ie until delivery of this assignment).

## Task 3 - Select and customize a process for the team

You have to find out if you want to follow a specific project methodology (XP, Scrum, Kanban), possibly which elements from different project methods (couple programming, testing etc) you want to include.

Discuss in the team which methods that could be used to help the team develop working and well-documented software during the programming project. Discuss which adaptations are needed to work well in such a student project, as well. Involve the TA in the discussion of possible problems.

Consider important aspects of the process. For example, how to organize meetings, definitions and assignment tasks, follow-ups,
which software development activities are needed (and when), which design activities are needed (and when). Write a brief description of the process in the process and project plan.

Discuss in the team how to organize yourselves during the project. Some Important Elements:

* Meetings, and frequency of meetings
* Communication between meetings
* Labor distribution
* Follow-up of work.
* Sharing and storing common documents, charts and the codebase.
  
Write a brief description of how your team is planning to organize the programming project.

## Part 4 assignment code

Within the deadline for this task, a small part of this delivery should be code.

A couple of good "first steps" are to show a two-dimensional game board, and place a piece on the board.

The emphasis of the end product's grading, will be on the game mechanics, so it is ok to use [Open Game Art] (https://opengameart.org/) for graphics. If the group has time towards the end, it is up to you whether you want to use this or if you want to produce something yourself.

## Summary

Perform a short project retrospective and discuss what went well, what did not work as expected, what (if any) did not work at all, and any new activities or tools that the team will test during the next exercise (oblig 3). Discuss why things worked or did not work. Write a brief summary of the discussion, and load
up to the team repo.

At the end of this you can make a small assessment of how good you were. This can be used to adjust how many tasks you intend to get into the next iteration, which is then delivered with oblig 3.

## Presentation

Prepare a short presentation (maximum 10 minutes of length), of the main results, challenges and solutions you found during this exercise. Include a summary of the retrospective meeting
and any changes planned for the first iteration of the programming project. Upload the slides to be used for the presentation in the team's repo, before the submission deadline.

## Assessment criteria and weighting

to get the thesis approved, the group must:

* Create a repo structure as described in task 1.
* Write sensible Commit messages when changes are uploaded in the group's repo.
* Upload the requested results in repo.
* Upload the delivery to github in markdown format.
* Delivery should be uploaded in separate folder in repo, called "Deliverables". Each oblig becomes "MandatoryX.md" in that folder. Any slides can be uploaded to the same folder.
* Take a commit of the source code that is the delivery of each oblig. This makes it easier for those who are considering doing so at the right time.

To get the assignment approved, each team member must:

* Meet and participate actively in at least 75% of weekly meetings with their TA and oblig.2 presentation.
* Perform the assigned tasks during and between these weekly meetings, as agreed by the team.
* Report back to the team on progress and / or problems that arise, as agreed in the team.

**Weighting:** This delivery counts for 12.5% ​​of the final grade.
